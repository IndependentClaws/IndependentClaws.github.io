		As Dorian makes its last gasps while it moves up the North American coast, the National Hurricane Center has its eye on two other storms brewing on either side of the United States.\n \n Neither storm is predicted at this time to reach land, but the hurricane center is monitoring them as they move and develop. Tropical Storm Gabrielle is in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. \n At 1,125 miles away from the nearest land the Azores -- an archipelago in the mid-Atlantic -- current forecasts from the National Hurricane Center have it moving west toward the United States before making a turn to the northeast, strengthening over open water, then fizzling out.\n No watches or warnings have been extended \n\nFor now, Gabrielle is struggling to develop over the open central Atlantic, with sustained winds midday Saturday at 50 mph, the hurricane center said. \n\n On the Pacific side of the continent sits Tropical Storm Juliette.Juliette is about 1,175 miles midday Saturday from the southern tip of Baja California, the hurricane center said.\n\n No warnings or watches have been issued for Juliette.\n\n The storm has maximum sustained winds of 45 mph, and it is expected to weaken steadily. \n\n \"Juliette is expected to become a post-tropical remnant low Saturday,\" the hurricane center said.
